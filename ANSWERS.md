## Questions

Go to `localhost:3000/teachers` in your browser; why does this not work?
A: It doesn't work because we didn't set anything for just /teachers, as in /teachers doesn't have any get request. 


What type of request did your browser just perform?
A: My browser just performed a post request at /teachers.

Go back to `localhost:3000/teachers/new`; submit the form again. What URL do you end up at?
A: We end up at localhost:3000/teachers


Why does `localhost:3000/teachers` work now?
A: It works now  because we had a post request to /teachers after we filled out the form with inputs.
